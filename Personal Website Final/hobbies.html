            <p>One of my biggest Hobbies is Running. Since high school when I joined the Anderson XC team, running has grown
               more and more on me. My best 5k time was at the ECC senior year when I got 18:24. Ever since high school, I
               still continue to run either with former xc friends or solo with my earbuds. Running with my garmin also helps
               me keep my pace and save my previous runs to look over and even set goals. I also have a strava account to post
               my runs and keep up with others.

         <img src="assets/airsoft.jpg" height="200px">
         <p>One other hobby of mine is doing airsoft battles with my friends. Every summer we go on a campout at one of my friends land in Indiana
            to do a couple of wars.

         <div-hobby-3>
         <img src="assets/switch.png" height="100px">
         <p>Another hobby I have is playing video games. While I do not have as much free time for gaming due to schoolwork,
            video games have always been a hobby of mine throughout my whole life. The first console I have ever played on was
            the Playstation 2 and the newest one I own is the Nintendo Switch.
